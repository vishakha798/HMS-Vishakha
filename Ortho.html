<p>Orthopedics is a medical specialty that deals with the treatment of bones and muscles. Orthopedic surgery is the branch of medicine concerned with diseases, injuries, and conditions of the musculoskeletal system relating to the body's muscles and skeleton. This includes the joints, ligaments, tendons, and nerves.
</p>
<p>Orthopedic conditions may be treated by your doctor or other medical specialists and heal thcare providers. Several doctors from different medical specialties may
 be involved in the treatment at the same time. This approach is important to manage the symptoms of an orthopedic condition, especially as many symptoms are long-term (chronic) and change over time.</p>
<p>This doctor specializes in orthopedic surgery. They may also be called an orthopedist. Orthopedists are educated in the workings of the musculoskeletal system. They can diagnose bone, muscle, joint, tendon, or ligament conditions. They can also treat an injury, provide rehabilitation (rehab), and advise on how to prevent further damage to a diseased area.

The orthopedist may have completed up to 14 years of formal education. After becoming licensed to practice medicine, the orthopedic surgeon may become board-certified by passing both oral and written exams given by the American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery. Many orthopedic surgeons choose to practice general orthopedics. Others specialize in certain areas of the body such as the foot, hand, shoulder, spine, hip, or knee. Others specialize in an area of orthopedic care such as sports medicine or trauma medicine. Some orthopedists may specialize in several areas and may collaborate with other specialists, such as neurosurgeons or rheumatologists, in caring for patients.</p>
